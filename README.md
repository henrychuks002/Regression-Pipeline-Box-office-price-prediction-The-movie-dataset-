A machine learning pipeline: Predicting the box office collection continuous price on a movie dataset with the machine learning regression techniques

### The Project
Actually a machine learning pipeline is a way to codify and automate the workflow it takes to produce everything a machine learning model needs. Machine learning pipelines consists of multiple sequential steps that does everything from data collection or extraction and preprocessing to model training and deployment


This project is about building a model that predicts the box office collection price on a movie dataset using the machine learning regression techniques. It takes input such as marketing expenses for each particular movie, production expenses, trailer view, movie length, ratings, budget, genre, twitter hashtags, multiplex coverage, trailer views etc. The model then returns its price prediction given all the input variables and then prediction accuracy alongside


This project utilizes the python streamlit framework to deploy the preferred model, the preferred is saved in a pickle file, and prediction is automated for any given input or test data with it
